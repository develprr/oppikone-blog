          		<h2 id="what-is-metamatic">What is Metamatic?</h2>
<p>I want to make you, dear Reader, to think about something unprecendented. I want to introduce a new term of <strong>Metamatic Systems</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's take a ride beyond the horizon of our comfort zones and think about the computing of tomorrow. What can we see looming beyond that horizon? Let's face it! A new kind of world might yet be like some shaky sprouts in the dawn mist but it will soon take shape and turn into something truly exciting.</p>
<p>Let's take breath for a second and think about what it could be like! Today's computing is all about <em>automation</em>. But automation is nothing new. Manufacturing processes were automated already a long time ago. Industry robots assemble endless rows of new shiny cars in factories around the world. Automation takes place in our personal computers as well. All software is about automation. Automation is about computer's faithful capability to follow predefined instructions. Automated systems are logical, reliable and predictable. They do exactly what they were told to. They can even react to different kinds of situations. Lean back on your coach after work day and have fun watching how your robot vacuum finds its way around obstacles. That is automation at its best!</p>
<h2 id="automation-2.0">Automation 2.0</h2>
<p>Well, automation is still only automation. At best, automation can mimic creative problem solving - but it essentially still is only a sequence of commands executed in predefined order. It has hardly anything to do with creative thinking that we humans - and perhaps our friends, animals - are so good at! We are so fantastically different from all automated systems that the task of assembling authentically intelligent systems almost felt frustrating at times!</p>
<p>But the pathway to inherently intelligent systems is real and it goes right through the expansion of already existing &quot;dumb&quot; automatic systems. Automatic Systems only need one missing essential ingredient. And that something is <strong>metadata</strong>. Who knows, tomorrow's world is about combine three-dimensional problem solving with fourth metadata dimension and playing around with four-dimensional metamatic problem solving.</p>
<h2 id="revising-oppikone-brand">Revising Oppikone Brand</h2>
<p>Therefore it is time revise to <strong>Oppikone</strong> trade name currently used to brand online learning services. For those fluent in Finnish language, Oppikone may be a witty word play combining words &quot;oppi&quot; which is a Finnish word meaning learning, study or doctrine and &quot;kone&quot; for machine. Those two words combined closely resemble word &quot;oppikoulu&quot; which is an old word for elementary school. Therefore Oppikone may be a nice name for online web services that target students in Finnish elementary schools.</p>
<p>But there are less than six million Finnish speakers in the world and in a global world it definitely is a more attractive idea to be comprehensible to many more people. To better address this need it is time to rethink brand and image name. Therefore Oppikone Ltd. will be using parallel trade name Metamatic for upcoming services and applications targeted to global public.</p>
<p>Yet this aim does not materialize as much more than this blog writing and auxiliary trade name <a href="https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi/yritystiedot.aspx?yavain=2383033&amp;tarkiste=F53E76C99B4F5E64869DF33D4E9A1589BED2350D">Metamatic Systems</a> in Finnish company registry but more upgrades have already been scheduled! To be used additionally with Metamatic, &quot;Systems&quot; suffix was selected because the Registry did not approve plain &quot;Metamatic&quot; and required a more specific auxiliatory word. &quot;Soft&quot; or &quot;Software&quot; would have sounded old-fashioned, &quot;Innovations&quot; just too silly and &quot;Solutions&quot; reminds of chemistry and liquids. So let it be the commonly used, yet quite neutral term &quot;Systems&quot; to both describe software - but in this case. even more generally the metamatic approach as a holistic philosophy rather than just a plain software-oriented way to see thinks.</p>
<p>This can't be too bad. Seriously, in Finland you can find software companies that want to appear as nuclear reactors, tiny spiky mammals, reindeer does, rice manufacturers or even failed space shuttles!</p>

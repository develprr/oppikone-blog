          		<h3>Why jQuery?</h3><p/>

jQuery is a widely used JavaScript library for DOM element manipulation, 
networking and much more. However, when you search online for articles about combining jQuery with ReactJS
you will find quite many postings written by ReactJS enthusiasts declaring that you should <b>not</b> use jQuery at all with ReactJS. Their reasoning goes usually that there is no
need at all to manipulate DOM directly because with ReactJS you never need to interact with real DOM directly since it is autogenerated from ReactJS's virtual DOM model. According to them, manipulating real DOM directly contradicts ReactJS's ideology and therefore should not be used at all. It sounds all reasonable except that it is...<p/>

<b>total nonsense!</b><p/>

First of all, those articles appear to forget systematically that <b>jQuery is a lot more than DOM manipulation</b>. For starters, jQuery offers all-powerful networking methods that are not covered by ReactJS. Well, now there are some ReactJS enthusiasts who want to challenge this and have started some projects to extend ReactJS with some networking. But how wise is that? Good luck with "rewriting in ReactJS" everything that has been coded in the world
until now! But if you are lazy like me, you don't want to re-invent everything but just rather ruthlessly use and benefit from everything that others have done before. 

<p>Just think about dozens of awesome UI libraries and components
that already exist, for instance <a href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui">Kendo UI</a> that is by far the leading UI library in the JavaScript world. Because Kendo is the best, I want to use Kendo for charting and many other aspects that it covers. You might have other preferences. You might like some other charting libraries. It is okay to feel that way. But I believe that you, if you think even a bit like me, don't have time to wait eons for some teenager to implement some luke warm "ReactJS-way"-imitation of your favorite library first. I  want to use the best solutions that I know and I want to use them <b>now</b>.</p>

<p>Luckily, you can combine Kendo UI with ReactJS. And you can combine almost anything else with ReactJS. You can do it if you use jQuery. Because jQuery is an all powerful Swiss army knife of JavaScript UI development and if you apply jQuery, you can embed Kendo UI and everything else seamlessly into your ReactJS app. Well, some might ask of course, why would you then use ReactJS at all if you can use Kendo. Well, that's a good question that I am not going to answer now. My mission is to show that you can use jQuery ubiquitously inside your ReactJS app <b>without contradicting</b> ReactJS's ideology. Cross-breed ReactJS and jQuery, take the best of both solutions, accelerate your development to the speed of light!</p>

<h3>Extending The Car App</h3>

<p>I showed in my <a href="http://www.oppikone.fi/blog/minimal-reactjs.html">earlier article</a> how to code a small app with ReactJS and callbacks. Let's extend that app a little to turn it into a good cornerstone for demonstrating Kendo integration with jQuery. The app will have two primary modes: one that is displayed when the user is not logged in and one that is displayed when the user is inside the app. When the user is logged out they must be provided with <b>LoginView</b> and when they are logged in they shall see the actual app, which I am going to call <b>ManagementView</b>. We'll modify our car app accordingly. The App component shall serve as a switch between these primary modes:</p>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:750px;font-size:small">
class App extends React.Component {
	
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);		
		this.state = {loggedIn: true};
		this.handleLoginSuccess = this.handleLoginSuccess.bind(this);	
		this.handleExitRequest = this.handleExitRequest.bind(this);
	}	
	
	handleLoginSuccess(event) {
		this.setState({ loggedIn: true });
	}

	handleExitRequest() {
		this.setState({ loggedIn: false });
	}

	createViewComponent() {
		if (this.state.loggedIn) {
			return React.createElement(ManagementView, { fireExitRequest: this.handleExitRequest });
		} else {
			return React.createElement(LoginView, { fireLoginSuccess: this.handleLoginSuccess });
		}
	}

	render() {	
		var viewComponent = this.createViewComponent();	
		return (
			<div className="container-fluid">
				<AppTitle name="Cars"/>				
				{viewComponent}
			</div>
		);
  	}
}
</textarea><p/>

Note that <b>render</b>-function contains a very simple html snippet which is mainly a Bootstrap wrapper around the actual view component. In render-function, the state of the app is checked. if the user is logged in then the view component is initialized as <b>ManagementView</b> but otherwise as <b>LoginView</b>. At this point the <b>App</b> doesn't need to know anything else than whether the user has been authenticated and must be let in and whether they request to be logged out so the app can switch to <b>LoginView</b> mode. Therefore I couple LoginView's actíon <b>fireLoginSuccess</b> with callback <b>handleLoginSuccess</b> and <b>ManagementView</b>'s action <b>fireExitRequest</b> with <b>handleExitRequest</b>. These handlers swap the <b>App</b>'s state between logged in and logged out by updating <b>loggedIn</b> state accordingly.<p/> 

Now let's have a look at <b>ManagementView</b> component:<p/>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:1500px;font-size:small">
class ManagementView extends React.Component {
	
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);		
		this.state = {loggedIn: true};
		this.handleCarModelSelected = this.handleCarModelSelected.bind(this);
		this.handleBackwardRequest = this.handleBackwardRequest.bind(this);
		this.handleExitRequest = this.handleExitRequest.bind(this);
	}	
	
	handleCarModelSelected(carModelId) {
		this.setState({ selectedCarModel: carModelId });
	}
	unSelectCarModel() {
		var selectedCarModel = this.selectedCarModel;
		this.setState({ 
			selectedCarModel: null,
			unSelectedCarModel: selectedCarModel		 
		});
	}
	
	reSelectCarModel() {
		var unSelectedCarModel = this.state.unSelectedCarModel;
		if (unSelectedCarModel) {
			this.setState({ 
				selectedCarModel: unSelectedCarModel	
			});
		}
	}

	handleBackwardRequest() {
		if (this.state.selectedCarModel) {
			this.unSelectCarModel();
		} else {
			this.reSelectCarModel();
		}
	}

	handleExitRequest() {
		this.props.fireExitRequest();
	}

	createViewComponent() {
		if (this.state.selectedCarModel) {
			return React.createElement(CarDetailView, {
				selectedCarModel: this.state.selectedCarModel
			});
		}		 
		return React.createElement(CarFilterList, {fireCarModelSelected: this.handleCarModelSelected } );	
	}
	
	
	render() {	
		var viewComponent = this.createViewComponent();
		var showBackButton = this.state.selectedCarModel? true : false;	
		return (
			<div className="management-view">
				<Navigation 
					showBackButton={showBackButton}
					fireBackwardRequest={this.handleBackwardRequest }
					fireExitRequest={this.handleExitRequest }					
				/>			 
			 	{ viewComponent }
			</div>
	
		);
  	}
}
</textarea><p/>

A look at <b>ManagementView</b>'s render function reveals the most of its purpose. It holds two components, a <b>Navigation</b> component and a view component. The view component is generated using <b>createViewComponent</b> method. In that method a decision is being made: if the user has already selected
a car model ( this.state.selectedCarModel is true ) then the view component will be instantiated as a <b>CarDetailView</b> that displays some information specific to that very car. But if there is no car model 
selected then the view component will be instantiated as a <b>CarFilterList</b>. CarFilterList will allow the user to select a car.<p/>

<h3>Modularity Through Callbacks</h3>

<p>This ReactJS app uses a simple callback technique to enable communication between components. It is a straightforward way to implement intercomponental communication and it's relatively simple to follow as well. Yet it has some caveats that justify a different approach called Redux. I will address the Redux way later on explaining in detail how it compares with a callback based approach.</p>

<p>In this callback-based implementation, see how <b>CarFilterList</b> is instantiated with some constructor parameters. These parameters define ManagementView's handleCarModelSelected as a callback <b>fireCarModelSelected</b> inside CarFilterList. It means that when CarFilterList "thinks" it is calling fireCarModelSelected, it will actually cause its parent component ManagementView to invoke handleCarModelSelected. So what's the difference? What we see here is actually a JavaScript equivalent of Java's interfaces. We can consider that the method fireCarModelSelected that CarFilterList "sees" is as an <b>interface</b> that ManagementView <b>implements</b> in handleCarModelSelected method. One cool thing about this approach is that it promotes modularity! CarFilterList can happily fire a "car model selected" message into the bit space without needing to care what actually happens somewhere else.<p/>

I also implemented a back button functionality here. ManagementView "listens" to Navigation component and handles backward navigation requests coming from there. For simplicity, I cheat here a little with back button functionality for now. Back button will be available only on <b>CarDetailView</b> an it will take back to ManagementView. This is achieved by unselecting the selected car. This state change will automatically lead to a view change which is certainly one strength of ReactJS approach. A proper way to implement back button functionality would be pushing view history into a stack and then popping them out one by one when back button is clicked. I'll address this issue later in more detail.<p/>
Now let's have a look at <b>Navigation</b> component:<p/>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:1000px;font-size:small">
class Navigation extends React.Component {

	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.onBackButtonClicked = this.onBackButtonClicked.bind(this);
		this.onExitButtonClicked = this.onExitButtonClicked.bind(this);
	}
	onBackButtonClicked() {
		this.props.fireBackwardRequest();
	}
	
	onExitButtonClicked() {
		this.props.fireExitRequest();
	}

	componentDidMount() {
		$("#back-button").click(this.onBackButtonClicked);
		$("#exit-button").click(this.onExitButtonClicked);
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div id="navigation-div" className="row">
				<div className="col-xs-12">
					 { this.props.showBackButton ? <BackButton fireBackButtonClicked={ this.onBackButtonClicked }/> : null }
								
					<button id="exit-button" type="button" className="btn btn-default btn-lg pull-right">
						<span className="glyphicon glyphicon-log-out" aria-hidden="true"></span> Exit
					</button>
				</div>
			</div>	
		)	
	}

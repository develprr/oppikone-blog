          		There has been a heresy around for a while suggesting that you cannot create good object oriented code in JavaScript without using either JavaScript's awkward native way of OOP called prototyping or non-JavaScript extensions such as ReactJS and TypeScript. When you use those frameworks, you are not programming plain JavaScript but rather creating files with a new syntax. Those files are then compiled into true JavaScript.
<p/>

Each framework has its advantage of course but you do not need to use ReactJS, TypeScript or any other framework to create effective object oriented code in JavaScript. With a little imagination, it is possible to create some very good object oriented code with plain good old non-falsified non-distorted JavaScript. In the following I'll show my way to code OOP in JavaScript.
<h3>Static Methods and Instance Methods</h3>
Anyone who knows Java is familiar with concepts of static methods and instance methods. Officially, there is no equivalent for these concepts in JavaScript. But pragmatically, you can have something very similar in JavaScript - without any third party extensions.

Let us create a class in plain old JavaScript. We want to create an abstract class called <em>Car </em>to represent all possible man made transportation tools.
<p>
<strong>var Car = {}</strong>
</p>
That is our Car class!  Now, let us add a static method to Car class telling the purpose of what "Car" means.
<p>
<br/>
Car.getPurpose = function()  {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Cars are designed to transport items or living things.";<br/>
}<br/>

</p>
Of course, if you are lazy like me sometimes, you can combine these two declarations, having:
<p>
<br/>
var Car = { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getPurpose: function() { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Cars are designed to transport items or living things."; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
}; <br/>
</p>

The method invocation for our new method looks like this:
<p style="font-weight:bold">
	Car.getPurpose();
</p>

<h3>Creating Instances of a Class</h3>

Now, it is nice to have a Car class but if we really want to do OOP we will want to create <i>instances</i> of
the <b>Car</b> class. That can be done by creating a <i>constructor method</i> for Car. This is how I do it:
<br/>
var Car = { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//a class method<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getPurpose: function() { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Cars are designed..."; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//a constructor for creating instances of Car<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new: function() { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return {}</b> <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
}; <br/>



<p>Now, the constructor method that we created returns an empty object equivalent to Java's hash map or C#'s dictionary.
Of course, an empty object like that doesn't convince us too much that it represents an instance of a car - it could 
be anything, really. So let's decide that any car must have an instance method to tell the color of that very vehicle.
Every car has at least a color, right?</p>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/1908_Ford_Model_T.jpg"></img>

<p>In remembrance of Henry Ford's black cars, we will decide that any vehicle's default
color is black unless otherwise instructed.
Therefore, we modify the constructor in a way that it returns a vehicle object having a method for getting its color:</p>



var Car = { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//a class method<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getPurpose: function() { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Cars are designed..."; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//a constructor for creating instances of Car<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new: function() { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> getColor: function() { return "black"; }</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
}; <br/>


<p>
Now, the invocation for creating a new instance of vehicle would look like this:
</p>

var myNewCar = Car.<b>new()</b>;<br/>

<p>And getting the color of the newly created vehicle instance is easy:</p>

var color = myNewCar.<b>getColor()</b>;

<p>
Well, we might get bored with black color at some point. What we really want is to create different
kinds of instances with different properties. Cars with different colors! We can achieve this diversity
by modifying the constructor method so that we can pass the color as a parameter value for each vehicle we create:</p>


var Car = { <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//a constructor for creating instances of Car<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>new: function(color)</b> { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>color: color</b>,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getColor: function(){ <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return <b>this.color;</b> <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
}; <br/>

<p>The modifications shown above added a color parameter to the constructor method of Car class. The constructor
returns a new object that has one variable color and a method for getting the value of that variable. Now,
let us create a blue vehicle:</p>

var myBlueCar = Car.<b>new("blue")</b>;

<p>And for convenience, let us get the color of our vehicle:</p>

var color = myBlueCar.<b>getColor()</b>;<br/>

<p>Needless to say, the color variable has now value "blue".</p>

<h3>Inheritance In JavaScript</h3>

Do you remember, I just promised to show a great way to create awesome object oriented code in JavaScript without using any
framework at all? Well, I lied! We do need a framework... Our framework is a one-liner and it comes here:<p/>

<p>
for (var attrname in obj2) { obj1[attrname] = obj2[attrname]; }
</p>

Feel free to copy-paste this awesome super modern OOP framework into your app! If you find it cool you can 
even wrap it into a reusable function:<p/>

function <b>extend</b>(obj1,obj2) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var attrname in obj2) { obj1[attrname] = obj2[attrname]; }<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return obj1;<br/>
}<p/>

With this fantastic open source framework I just gave away for free it is possible to do some serious OOP in JavaScript. Namely,
we can <i>extend</i> classes to create new classes that <i>inherit</i> features of their ancestor class. If you need a name
for this framework let's call it <b>AwesomenessJS</b>. Now let's use our framework to try out inheritance. We'll
create a very certain type of car, a road train.<p/> 
 
<img style="max-width:224px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Road_train-cropped.jpg"></img><p/>

When talking about road trains, which are in deed very large trucks, it is understable that the number of
wheels is a significant attribute. If you know how many wheels a road train has you will have a picture about what kind of a truck we are talking about.

<p/>
var <b>RoadTrain</b> = {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<b>new:</b> function(color,wheelCount) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		return <b>extend</b>(Car.<b>new</b>(color), {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			wheelCount: wheelCount,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			<b>getWheelCount</b>: function() {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;				return this.wheelCount;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			}<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		});<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	}<br/>	
};<br/>

<p>
The code described above enables us to construct road trains of variable colors and wheels, for instance:
<p/>

var greenHugeRoadTrain = RoadTrain.<b>new("green",18)</b>;
<p/>

We can check the number of wheels of our road train anytime:<p/>
<b>var wheelCount = greenHugeRoadTrain.getWheelCount();</b>
<p/>

Since the RoadTrain class extends a super class Car, we can also check the color:<p/>

var color = greenHugeRoadTrain.<b>getColor();</b><p/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I just showed a couple of small principles that I figured out at some point in the past. 
Using these tricks has helped me a lot. You might ask what is the purpose of using this sort
of ad hoc OOP hacks to create software since you can possibly take TypeScript or something else
that is a full blown OOP extension for JavaScript.<p/>

The answer is simplicity. If you can achieve a cutting edge advantage with very simple means,
without adding yet another framework into your project, that will hugely reduce the overall complexity of 
your software. The fact is that the more dependencies you add to your project the less maintainable it will 
be. Just if you can create serious software with plain JavaScript can be a game changer in terms of simplicity
and maintainability! <b>Adding dozens of frameworks and dependencies, that is for the weak coders!</b><p/>

<p>One more word of warning: If you use extensions that are no true JavaScript (such as TypeScript, CoffeeScript,
GWT, just name it!) you are not creating real JavaScript code. But your compiler will turn your code
into JavaScript anyway. The browser only understands JavaScript. Now, when your code needs debugging
you will need to dig into plain old JavaScript anyway: you end up debugging machine-made JavaScript that is
generated from your original code! So why wouldn't you code JavaScript already in the first place? Just because you can?<p/>

These examples with Car and RoadTrain are just examples, of course, to underline some concepts. Some common
cases where you possibly need inheritance could be creating different kinds of validators for text fields and 
other form components. All validators might have some common features like checking whether its input field
contains a value or not. You might want to extend the base validator feature in all validators that inherit from it. 
If you want to create a validator for a number field, you might want to check two things: first, does the field
have a value at all (if it is a required field)? And secondly, is the value that the user entered within an
allowed range? The basic existential validation is implemented in the super class and the range validation
is implemented in the subclass that extends the base class. I used inheritance in validators very recently,
in a successful customer project where the imperative was to create highly dynamic forms generated in a JavaScript
client running in the browser.

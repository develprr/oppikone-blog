          		<h3>Why ReactJS?</h3><p/>

If you think you are good at JavaScript programming there are
changes that you still won't get a project unless you are familiar with ReactJS.
That is because ReactJS is momentarily in the center of a hype-storm and will remain there until the next 
framework pops up that will get the hyper crown. Remember, the previous hyper king was AngularJS
and before that there were many others like Backbone, JavaScriptMVC, EmberJS etc.
But right now, despite all of its conceptual blunders, you'd better know some ReactJS!<p/>

<h3>Installation</h3><p/>

It's always useful to get started with new frameworks by checking out some complete examples that already have
a readily made project structure. For ReactJS, there are many tutorial repos available for instance 
<a href="https://github.com/arkency/reactjs_koans">Koans ReactJS github repo</a>. 
But of course, you can also install a very basic example project directly from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html">Facebook's repository</a>.
<p/>
In my last <a href="http://www.oppikone.fi/blog/javascript-oop.html">blog post</a> I introduced some (who knows?) controversial 
OOP hacks using car-related examples to demonstrate inheritance. Therefore, we'll remain in the car manufacturing business in this
blog post as well, creating a web frontend for our car models.<p/>

It's time to put some Car concepts into production and create a Car App with ReactJS! For this reason, the 
sample project will have name <b>my-car-app</b>. As a prequisite, first install ReactJS toolkit: <p/>

<b>npm install -g create-react-app</b><p/>

But please note that if you use Ubuntu Linux and want to install NodeJS via apt-get you will encounter a problem when trying to use
ReactJS-related npm tools that depend on NodeJS. When you execute:<p/>

<b>create-react-app my-car-app</b>
<p/>
There are changes that you'll get an error:<p/>
	
<b>/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory</b><p/>

No need to panic! The problem occurs only because in Ubuntu, NodeJS is named as "nodejs" while
npm expects "node". You just need to create a symbolic link
that fixes the problem: <p/>

<b>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node</b><p/>

<p>Beware that your default NodeJS version might be deprecated. If that is the case you'll get a warning when using npm
to install ReactJS related tools - and even worse: they won't work!</p> Just download the newest NodeJS version from <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS web site</a>
and extract it to wherever you like. Remember to update the symlink accordingly. I have: <p/>

<b>sudo ln -s /home/heikki/tools/node-v6.9.1-linux-x64/bin/node /usr/bin/node</b><p/>

If this doesn't fix it it's probably because you are using operating system's default npm installation which might
be deprecated. Uninstall npm and create a symlink to npm installation as well:<p/>

<b>sudo ln -s /home/heikki/tools/node-v6.9.1-linux-x64/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm</b><p/>

Then create the project directory (if you didn't do so yet) and start the development server:<p/>
<b>create-react-app my-car-app</b><br/>
<b>cd my-car-app<br/>
npm start</b><p/>

<h3>Creating First App With ReactJS</h3><p/>

If everything went right you should have a skeleton for your first ReactJS app by now. The main application file has
been generated as ./src/App.js. You can just start tweaking it to create an app you always wanted to have.<p/>

When you want to publish the production version of your App make sure that you have a pushstate server installed:<p/>

<b>npm install -g pushstate-server</b><p/>

Note that you might run into problems if you are running Debian "Wheezy". If that's the case upgrade your Debian to "Jessie" or just use Ubuntu.<p/>

And finally build your app:<p/>

<b>npm run build</b><p/>

<iframe style="border-radius:10x;max-width:300px;width:100%;height:300px" src="http://www.oppikone.fi/reactjs-demo/my-car-app-0"></iframe><p/>

That's how it works. The result is also available <a href="http://www.oppikone.fi/reactjs-demo/my-car-app-0">here.</a> In the next
demo I'll add a search feature into Car App to find car models.<p/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3><p/>

There are some parties that are erratically praising ReactJS as some kind of a silver bullet in
UI development. However, ReactJS covers really only the View aspect of MVC (Model-View-Controller) trinity. 
Any software, whether running in a browser or somewhere else, 
consists of many aspects and rendering views is just a tip of the ice berg.<p/>
To build good software, ReactJS is not all what you need. You can use ReactJS to render views but you don't need ReactJS really
to do it. There are many alternatives for rendering views. Also ReactJS's virtual DOM operations are rather cumbersome compared
with JQuery's power and flexibility. ReactJS tries to solve this issue by using JSX templates. However, JSX has a downside that it
must be embedded in "JavaScript" code (which isn't true JavaScript either) that is then compiled into real JavaScript. If you
really want to separate templates from JavaScript code (which is truly recommendable) you'll be better off when you
use some templating engine such as EmbeddedJS (EJS) or MustacheJS. Those templates can be loaded dynamically from server on demand using Ajax.
When making Ajax requsts, JQuery is what you need. ReactJS does not provide Ajax features.<p/>

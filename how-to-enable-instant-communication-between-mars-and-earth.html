In this article I will explain how to enable instant communication between Mars and Earth.
</p>
<p>
Using radio or light waves for communication between distant peers such as Mars and Earth is notoriously slow due to great distance of these two objects. When
it takes 8 minutes for a light beam to travel from Earth to Mars then it will take 16 minutes to receive answer to a question that was sent. This delay renders communication methods such as phone calls impractical.
</p>
<p>
However, there might be a way to enable instant communication over great distances. This effect could be achieved through the use of entangled quantum particles. There is evidence that it is possible to create particles that will always share the same state regardless of their position. However, their state is only determined when they are observed first time. It has been previously proposed that this nature of entangled particles can be used for encrypting messages.</p>

<p>In this article I go further and propose that entangled quantum particles could also be used to achieve instant messaging over great distances. Achieving this effect might be possible if a particle generator is placed in a location in space that has exactly the same distance to both targets, for instance Mars and Earth. The generator then beams those entangled quantum particles to both Mars and Earth. This beam must be a non-stop stream that creates the potential ("raw material") for instant communication.</p>

<p>When a device that is located on Mars wants to send an instant message to Earth, it only needs to observe particles received from the generator in a meaningful way. By the
meaningful way I mean using observation as a tool to mark their state to either one or zero, following the binary system. Due to entanglement of these particles, those observations performerd on Mars will also change the state of their twin particles that simultaneously arrived on Earth. On Earth, there must be a second device that reads the twin particles instantly after they were observed on Mars. We have now effectively achieved instant message delivery from Mars to Earth. To send an instant response from Earth to Mars, the same procedure can be used. The observer device located on Earth then observes entangled quantum particles beamed by the generator located in the space. These observations will change the state of these particles in a way that formulates a meaningful response message to Mars-located peer. The reader placed on Mars will then read the state of their engtangled twin particles that simultaneously arrived on Mars. </p>

<p>Using this technique, instant communication between Mars and Earth might be achieved. If this method works, it will have a great potential to enable no-delay phone calls and video calls between participants located too far away from each other for practical communication over traditional methods such as radio or light wave based solutions.</p>

<p>I challenge all capable scientists and engineers to implement this system in the coming days of miraculous scientific breakthroughs. Or at least explain to me why it cannot work! :) </p>

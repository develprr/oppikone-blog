          		<h3>Neural Networks, Cars and OOP</h3><p/>

In my <a href="http://www.oppikone.fi/blog/javascript-oop.html">previous post</a> I introduced some easy techniques that enable you to program with JavaScript in an object oriented manner.
I used some examples with imaginary cars to demonstrate inheritance. However, it would be great to have examples that already have practical value as such.<p/>
Therefore I'll try to demonstrate JavaScript OOP (object oriented programming) with some more useful examples than just cars. I am going to implement 
a neural network. But first of all, just what is a neural network?<p/>

<h3>Neural Network - What Is It Good For?</h3><p/>

"Neural Network" is a very brutally abused term. It makes people think of all kinds of crazy sci-fi movie fantasies.
In reality, a neural network is just a set of some useful algorithms. Let's say that you have a table in an SQL database
that contains rows of customer data. What is their turnover, how many employees, how much profit they made and so on and did they
buy your product or not. There is probably some kind of correlation between all attributes and if they bought the product.
You feed the database table into a neural network and it will learn that correlation.
<p/>
Next time, you have some new companies on your list and you are worrying which ones might be potential customers. Well,
you just feed the data you have about them into the neural network and it will - based on previous examples - tell
which ones probably would buy the product. This information will save from quite many fruitless phone calls!
 
<h3>Creating Neuron And Neural Net</h3><p/>

Sounds great! Now, let's get down to business. I will try to create a simple neural network in JavaScript. Needless
to say, there are many neural network implementations in many programming languages and there are many online services
providing neural network functionality. But if you really want to understand how something works you must create one
by yourself.<p/>

Animal and human brains consist of billions of neurons that are somehow interconnected and somehow enable those animal
and human brains to think.<p/>

<img style="width:100%;max-width:300px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/PurkinjeCell.jpg"/><p/>

So that's why I guess that we need to start by coding a neuron:

<p>

<b>var</b> Neuron = {};<p/>

That's the neuron class. Now I'll add a constructor method so we can get many instances of neurons. I guess, to create 
a clever thing we need to have tons of neurons.<p/>

Neuron.<b>new</b> = function() {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //let's figure out later what a neuron contains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b> {};<br/>
}</br>

<p>And to have a really cluster of neurons we need a neural network to contain all neurons:</p>

<b>var</b> NeuralNet = {};<p/>

<p>A very basic neural network known as multilayer perceptron typically has a layer of input neurons, hidden neurons and output neurons.
Let's add a constructor that takes those values as parameters:

<p>
NeuralNet.new = <b>function</b>(inputNeuronCount,hiddenNeuronCount,outputNeuronCount) { <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b> {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inputNeuronCount: inputNeuronCount,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hiddenNeuronCount: hiddenNeuronCount,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputNeuronCount: outputNeuronCount<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
};</p>

The parameters passed above instruct the neural network on configuration of its layers. A multilayer perceptron (MLP)
often only contains really three layers of neurons. It is possible to have many hidden
layers but it depends on the case. Adding many hidden layers does not automatically make a network "more clever". Therefore, "multilayer" perceptron might be initially disappointing to those 
who wish to see a software equivalent to brain neurons: brain neurons appear to form endlessly deep networks. A "multilayer"
neuron that only can afford three layers hardly resembles the construction of thousands or billions of layers that can be found in 
a biological neural network.<p/>

But no need to be discouraged! Despite of their hollowness, multilayer perceptrons are apparently still very useful for machine learning 
purpose. They can be used as building blocks for truly deep networks. It just does not happen by adding more hidden layers but
rather chaining them up into recurrent networks instead. According to my current understaning, neural network models better suited for recurrency than MLP are Hopfield, Elman and bi-directional RNN.
But MLP is a good workhorse for many classification tasks and a robust launchpad for seeking deeper wisdom!<p/>

<h3>Creating Layers</h3><p/>

<p>NeuralNet class serves as a container for layers that are created when the neural net is instantiated. Let us create constructors 
for layers. We create first a super class NeuronLayer that will contain the common features of a neuron layer. Then we create
input, output and hidden layers that extend the base class.<p/>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:400px" >
      
       var NeuronLayer = {
		new: function(neuronCount) {
			return {
				neuronCount: neuronCount
			}
		}
	};
	
       var InputLayer = {
		new: function(neuronCount) {
			return extend(NeuronLayer.new(neuronCount),{});
		}
       };
	
       var HiddenLayer = {
		new: function(neuronCount) {
			return extend(NeuronLayer.new(neuronCount),{});
		}
       };

       var OutputLayer = {
		new: function(neuronCount) {
			return extend(NeuronLayer.new(neuronCount),{});
		}
       };
</textarea>
<p/>
Now the classes for layers have been introduced. Please check my <a href="http://www.oppikone.fi/blog/javascript-oop.html">previous post</a> for <b>extend</b> function. 
The next step is to modify NeuralNet's constructor to initialize the layers:
<p/>
<textarea style="width:100%;height:300px" >
	NeuralNet.new = function (inputNeuronCount,hiddenNeuronCount,outputNeuronCount) { 
		return  {
			inputLayer: InputLayer.new(inputNeuronCount),
			hiddenLayer: HiddenLayer.new(hiddenNeuronCount),
			outputLayer: OutputLayer.new(outputLayerCount)
		};
	};
</textarea>

<p>In case the neural network needs to have more than one hidden layer it is useful to modify the constructor to allow multiple hidden layers:</p>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:500px" >
	NeuralNet.new = function (inputNeuronCount,outputNeuronCount,hiddenLayerNeuronCounts) { 
		var neuralNet  {
			inputLayer: InputLayer.new(inputNeuronCount),
			hiddenLayers: [],
			outputLayer: OutputLayer.new(outputLayerCount)
		};

		for (var i = 0; i < hiddenLayerNeuronCounts.length; i++) {
			var hiddenLayerNeuronCount = hiddenLayerNeuronCounts[i];
			neuralNet.hiddenLayers.push(HiddenLayer.new(hiddenLayerNeuronCount));
		}
		return neuralNet;
	};
</textarea>
<p/>
Since JavaScript is a weakly typed language you don't need (and you can't) define data types in parameters. Therefore it is
recommendable for clarity to name variables in a way that suggests their data type. For instance, "outputNeuron<b>Count</b>" intuitively
indicates an integer value and "hiddenLayerNeuron<b>Counts</b>" refers to an array of integers. In my opinion!<p/>

Using the constructor I described above, let's create a neural net with two input neurons, one output neuron and one hidden layer with four neurons:<p/>

<b>var neuralNet = NeuralNet.new(2,1,[4]);</b><p/>

For comparison, if we wanted a neural net with two input neurons, one output neuron, one hidden layer with four neurons and
one hidden layer with three neurons, we would code:<p/>

<b>var neuralNet = NeuralNet.new(2,1,[4,3]);</b><p/>

Now it's time to have a new iteration of neuron layers. Each layer contains an array of neurons. We'll modify NeuronLayer
to initialize its neurons instead of jus holding a dummy number to tell the total number of neurons.<p/>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:400px" >
      
       var NeuronLayer = {
		new: function(neuronCount) {
			var neuronLayer = {
				neurons: []
			};
			for ( var i = 0; i < neuronCount; i++) {
				var neuron = Neuron.new();
				neuronLayer.neurons.push(neuron);
			}
			return neuronLayer;	
		}
	};
</textarea>

<h3>Training Data</h3><p/>

Neural network's purpose is to learn a certain dataset. The dataset is basically a table of numbers. Each column of the 
table represents a certain property and each row represents a possible value combination for those properties. This
goes well for all datasets that already have continuous values. In case of discrete values (such as categories) the 
case is more tricky because then the categories must be normalized which will then cause a lot more columns. But 
it works, anyway. The data must be also normalized so that all values will be something between 0 and 1. 
A neural network consisting of multilayer percetrons is useful in classifying tasks. For instance, you can teach
the network labeled examples of different species of flowers. Then you can let the trained network use its "wisdom"
and label some new unlabeled flower data. A classical example of this is the Iris dataset that contains variations of Iris
-flower subspecies pedal lengths.<p/>

The simplest and probably most common example training data sample, however, is XOR operator. XOR operator data is already
in normalized form (1's and 0's) and its training data is easy to generate. XOR operator takes two parameters and returns true
if they differ from each other and false if they are same. The task is to teach the neural network to understand the
logic of a XOR operator. Let's create training data for XOR operator:<p/>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:500px" >
	var XORTrainData = {
		getRandomZeroOrOne: function() {
			return parseInt(Math.random() + 0.5);
		},
				
		generate: function() {	
			var matrix = [];
			for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
				var param1 = this.getRandomZeroOrOne();
				var param2 = this.getRandomZeroOrOne();
				var result = (param1 === param2) ? 0 : 1; // XOR OPERATOR!!!
				matrix.push([param1,param2,result]);
			}
			return matrix;
		}
		
	}
</textarea>
<p/>
Now, we get our training data for XOR operator:<p/>

<b>var</b> trainingData = XORTrainData.generate();<p/>

<h3>Training Procedure</h3><p/>

When training a neural network with train data, the data matrix is being fed into the neural network row by row. On each iteration,
the error margin decreases. Training is ready when the error is smaller than a threshold value. Training can also be
stopped until a desired number of iterations is reached. This means that two barrier values must be set before the 
training starts: maximum number of iterations and error threshold value. For example:<p/>

<textarea style="width:100%;height:500px">
	var trainData = XORTrainData.generate();
	
	var inputNeuronCount = 2;
	var outputNeuronCount = 1;
	var hiddenLayerCounts = [4];
	
	var network = NeuralNet.new(
			inputNeuronCount,
			outputNeuronCount,
			hiddenLayerCounts);
	
	var maxIterationsCount = 100;
	var errorThresholdValue = 0.01;	
	network.train(trainData, maxIterationsCount,errorThresholdValue);
</textarea>

<p>This procedure can be compared with a blind man with a golf club whom you want to teach hitting the hole. Every time you shout
"fire!" the blind fellow launches. You check by how wide margin he misses the hole and then you tell him something like "adjust left 2 meters". 
The blind fellow then launches again. You repeat this procedure until the ball hits the hole (threshold value reached) or you just run out of golf balls (maximum number of iterations reached).</p>

<img src="http://www.blindgolf.co.uk/uploads/images/Jim%20Hole%20in%20one.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:350px"/><p/>

Given that the blind man is a neural network (actually, he is!) and his brain cells are neurons (in deed, they are!) then let <b>NeuralNet.train()</b> be the function to 
to teach him to hit the hole. Training consists of many repetitions until the targeted skill level is reached (threshold) or the
resources reserved for training are suffocated without reaching the objective (max iterations). Basically
almost any training has one thing in common. It is a procedure of exhaustive iterations. Think about teaching 
a dog to do a trick, a ski jumper pursuing a new record, just anything. Training a neural network can be modeled
in JavaScript program code similarly:<p/> 

<textarea style="width:100%;height:800px">

NeuralNet.train = function(trainData,maxIterationsCount,errorThresholdValue) {	
	
	
	var currentIterationCount = 0;
	var currentErrorMargin = 1.0;

	while (currentErrorMargin > errorThresholdValue)
		
		if (currentIterationCount === maxIterationCount) {
			break;
		}	

		currentErrorMargin = NeuralNet.iterate(trainData);

		currentIterationCount++;
	}
}

</textarea>

This is all very simple so far. But miracles start to unravel when we dive in to explore what happens inside all those countless iterations!
